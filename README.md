# Coffe_house
Created a simple Coffee house ordering system with menu and order customisation included. This has been developed using basic Concepts of C++.

Vectors have been used to store the menu and customisation options.

Improvements to be made: (though dont relly on me I am very lazy, May do it when feeling bored. Would love it if uall would contribute.)
1)  Get the items on the menu and customisation option from an encrypted Excel file.
2)  Put colours to the text, change font style and make it look better.
3)  Remove redundant Code or variable making code more efficient.
